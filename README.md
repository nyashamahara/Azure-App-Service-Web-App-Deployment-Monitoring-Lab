#  Azure App Service Web App Deployment & Monitoring Lab

This hands-on lab demonstrates the complete lifecycle of deploying, staging, swapping, and monitoring an Azure App Service Web App using the Azure Portal. The project covers essential real-world practices such as deployment slot management, environment configuration, zip-based deployment, and application diagnostics


 # Key Learning Objectives
 
* Understand how Azure App Service works and the different plan tiers

* Create and configure an App Service Plan (S1 Tier, Windows OS)

* Deploy a production-ready Web App using zip push deployment

* Configure staging and production slots for seamless updates and rollback

* Swap slots with preview and manage slot-specific settings

* Enable application logging and monitor with Azure built-in tools

* Use Kudu for advanced app deployment and diagnostics
